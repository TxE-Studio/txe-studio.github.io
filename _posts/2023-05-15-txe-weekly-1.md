**by TxE Studios and DevGames**


TxE Studio (aka DevGames) is now creating 4 modes in the Unreal Editor for Fortnite.

## Highgames are coming next year
Next year we will release 3-4 new Highgames modes:

- Highgames: Apocalypse
<br>

The zombies are here! Defend the castle, rescue survivors and kill all monsters.

- Highgames: Century Wars
<br>

In this mode, two teams (20 players per team) compete for highgames royale. The storm is fast, monsters spawn throughout the game, and you get random loot when you eliminate an opponent.

- Highgames: Reality Defense
<br>

Reality is broken! In this 4 player mode, you and your team must save reality before it shatters into pieces*

- Highgames: Dropzone
<br>

In this mode, 4 teams fight for the information that falls from the sky! Each intel contains at least 1 weapon, 1 perk, and materials. Respawn is enabled **until the storm reaches the 4th zone**. The last team left wins the game.

## TxE Studios x DevNite
We've teamed up with our UE4 development team and are working on a **new** DevNite Battle Royale game. Since TFNGames no longer exists and we wanted to help our UE4 team, we are now working on it together. Stay tuned for more updates.

*We will release this mode later than the other.
